# Align

In Align, you control a lost character trying to find their way home across islands scattered throughout the night sky.

With no convenient moves such as jumping or climbing, you look to the stars to help you on your way.

# Gameplay

Every level has a set of stars above and a real world below.

Take full advantage of the VR capabilities to look at each puzzle from every angle.

Reach your controller out and align the stars to guide your player through the night.
